# App scenario, part 2

> **This playground requires the CwlSignal.framework built by the CwlSignal_macOS scheme.** If you're seeing errors finding or building module 'CwlSignal', follow the Build Instructions on the [Contents](Contents) page.

## Dynamic view properties

This page shows a fictional scenario: you're selecting files to upload to a server. In the foreground, the user selects files to upload while in the background, the server connection changes between two different servers or not connected at all.

1. Checkbox (checked if connected to a server, label shows server's name)
2. Text label (show the count of selected files)
3. Add to favorites button (enabled only if server is connected *and* file selection is non-empty).

If you're reading through the code, the most important part to focus on is the three "dynamic properties" at the bottom of the `loadView` function. These take data provided by incoming signals and apply the result to the views.

## Using the Assistant View

To display the "view" for this playgrounds page, you should enable the Playgrounds "Live View" Assistant View. To do this,

1. Make sure you can see Assistant Editor (from the menubar: "View" → "Assistant Editor" → "Show Assistant Editor").
2. Use the toolbar at the top of the Assistant Editor to select "Live View" (the popup you need is to the right of the "< >" arrows but to the left of the filename/filepath.

The page will automatically animate through a series of states.
