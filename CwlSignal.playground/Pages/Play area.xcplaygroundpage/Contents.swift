# Experiment with CwlSignal

> **This playground requires the CwlSignal.framework built by the CwlSignal_macOS scheme.** If you're seeing errors finding or building module 'CwlSignal', follow the Build Instructions on the [Contents](Contents) page.

This page contains a couple quick and simple examples you can play with to try and understand some of the basics of CwlSignal.

Signal<String>.generate { input in

		i.send("ðŸ‘»", "ðŸŽƒ", "ðŸ‘¹", "ðŸ˜ˆ")

print("Aggregates four smileys into single string:")

// `Signal.just(_:...)` creates a signal using the provided values and `toSequence` offers synchronous conversion back to a Swift `Sequence` type. The `aggregate` operator turns a signal of many values into a signal of one value (in this case, by concatenating the strings). The `next()` function is the Swift Standard Library Sequence function â€“ it gets the only value in the sequence after the `aggregate` operator collapsed the four smileys down to a single string.
let aggregated = Signal<String>
	.just("ðŸ˜€", "ðŸ™ƒ", "ðŸ˜‰", "ðŸ¤£")
	.aggregate("Start: ") { return $0 + $1 }
	.toSequence()
	.next()!
