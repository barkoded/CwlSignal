/// This protocol exists to keep alive and terminate-at-will asynchronous and ongoing tasks (an implementation of the "Disposable" pattern).
///
/// While conformance to this protocol requires just one function, conforming to this protocol also signals three important traits:
///    1. instances manage an underlying resource
///    2. the resource will last until one the first of the following end-conditions occurs:
///        a. It terminates on its own
///        b. All references to the Lifetime instance are released
///        c. The `cancel()` function is invoked
///    3. subsequent calls to `cancel()` after a previous end-condition will have no effect
///
/// ideally, as well:
///
///    4. `cancel()` and releasing all references to the instance should have the same effect
///    5. no further effects or actions of any kind will occur after the first end-condition is registered in the
///       resource's context.
///
/// although there are some cases where explicitly sending "cancelled" notifications is valid behavior and where this
/// type of notification might be triggered when `cancel()` is called but not `deinit`.
///
/// The protocol requires the `cancel` function exist but it is up to conforming types to follow the rules.

	/// Immediately set the resource managed by this instance to an "end-of-life" state.
